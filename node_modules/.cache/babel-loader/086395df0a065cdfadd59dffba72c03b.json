Step 1: Install or create Open your terminal and enter the following: npm install -g create-react-app create-react-app hello-world cd hello-world npm run build npm install netlify-cli -g netlify deploy Or deploy a create-react-app site with Netlify Functions support with just 1 click: Deploy to Netlify Step 2: Choose a new project If you are using the netlify CLI, follow command line prompts and choose yes for new project and ./build as your deploy folder and voila you have a production React app! You can also link to a GitHub repo for continuous deployment for specified branches and will grant you our nifty Deploy Preview feature. Happy Hacking :) Step 3: Redirect and rewrite rules If you choose to use something for routing (like React Router for example), you will need to set up a redirect and rewrite rule for the single page app. That redirect rule would look like this: /*    /index.html   200 This redirect rule above will serve the index.html instead of giving a 404 no matter what URL the browser requests.
